abstract = {ML models are increasingly being pushed to mobile devices, for low-latency inference and offline operation. However, once the models are deployed, it is hard for ML operators to track their accuracy, which can degrade unpredictably (e.g., due to data drift). We design Nazar, the first end-to-end system for continuously monitoring and adapting models on mobile devices without requiring feedback from users. Our key observation is that often model degradation is due to a specific root cause, which may affect a large group of devices. Therefore, once Nazar detects a consistent degradation across a large number of devices, it employs a root cause analysis to determine the origin of the problem and applies a cause-specific adaptation. We evaluate Nazar on two computer vision datasets, and show it consistently boosts accuracy compared to existing approaches. On a dataset containing photos collected from driving cars, Nazar improves the accuracy on average by 15%.},

author	= {Lingxiao Li and Yi Zhang and Shuhui Wang},
year	= {2023},
abstract = {Few-shot image generation is a challenging task since it aims to generate diverse new images for an unseen category with only a few images. Existing methods suffer from the trade-off between the quality and diversity of generated images. To tackle this problem, we propose Hyperbolic Attribute Editing(HAE), a simple yet effective method. Unlike prior arts that work in Euclidean space, HAE captures the hierarchy among images using data from seen categories in hyperbolic space. Given a well-trained HAE, images of unseen categories can be generated by moving the latent code of a given image toward any  meaningful directions in the Poincar√© disk with a fixing radius. Most importantly, the hyperbolic space allows us to control the semantic diversity of the generated images by setting different radii in the disk. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that HAE is capable of not only generating images with promising quality and diversity using limited data but achieving a highly controllable and interpretable editing process.},

  title={Model Checking the Reliability of Data Center Network}, 
  abstract={Data center network provides a basis for internet-based applications nowadays, thereby the reliability of it is vital. The purpose of this research is to examine and compare the reliability of two data center network architectures, which are Common Tree and Fat-tree topology structure. To verify the reliability of these two architectures, a tool called PRISM with the function of probabilistic model checking is used in this paper. Results show that Fat-tree topology structure is more reliable than Common Tree, and the reliabilities of core layer, edge/ aggregation layer and terminal layer decline sequentially.},
